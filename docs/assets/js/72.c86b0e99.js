Such general principles are at a high level of abstraction. They, therefore, serve as general guidelines that should not be violated.\nPrinciples and guidelines may, for example, derive from standards such as the ISO/IEC 9241 series of usability standards. Such guidelines are more concrete, for example, "colour should not be used as the only means of representing information". Such guidelines are more concrete but typically platform-independent.\nEstablished conventions are, for example, platform standards such as those of Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS, and iOS or Android. An example of such a platform convention is "A dialog always has an \'OK\' and a \'Cancel\' button.
